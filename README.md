This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict insurance charges based on customer demographics and lifestyle attributes (e.g., age, BMI, smoker status).
It includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, hyperparameter tuning, explainability with SHAP, and prepares the trained model for deployment in a Flask web application.
